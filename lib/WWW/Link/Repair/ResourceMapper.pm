WWW::Link::Repair::Mapper - map urls to objects which can fix resources

=head1 SYNOPSIS

NOT IMPLEMENTED

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<This module is not yet in use.  It is a placeholder and I am not yet
convinced that it will be used, but it is likely that eventually I
will find reason for it.>

Mapper objects know about how to repair aned edit resources pointed to
by specific URLS.  

They match regular expressions against the given URLs in string
format.  They then apply a translation function if one is provided to
translate that url into a new URL.  This is repeated until a non
remappable translation is found (if more than a maximum number of
translations has been carried out the translation dies to detect
problems).  Finally they apply the functions registered against the
finaly translation and do the appropriate editing.

We need a regexp, optionally followed by a list of functions that can
be applied.

convert_to_file
edit_file
convert_from_file
edit_in_place

This applies the translation by checking the given url against the
