Link is a demonstrator module.  I want to see what is useful to do
with Links.  One clear thing I'd like to do soon is start to store
Links (partially?) in relational databases so that some attributes can
be used directly in web page generation (the rest is obvious :-).  The
only question is what should be stored where and how.
