Link is a largely experimental module for storing information about
Links (such as hyperlinks between documents).  I use it within my link
checking system LinkController, but I think that the ideas and code
included could be extended to become generally useful.  Also, I'd like
to provide a public interface to the information which LinkController
contains and that is what WWW::Link will eventually evolve into.

I feel at some point soon an object-relational re-implementation of
some kind may become useful.  So far, the benefits of the simple
semi-persistant object model of MLDBM have outweighed that,
particularly because I don't yet need sophisticated reporting.  This
will most probably change when I want to use information directly in
web page generation.

If you have any thoughts about this module, then please send a mail to
my CPAN address and I'll be happy to consider them and maybe even code
them for you.

All of this means that all interfaces are subject to change without
notice.
