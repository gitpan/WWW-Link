0.34 - Sun Jan 06 2002

	We handle correctly fixing of links with fragments.
	Previously we failed to fix these.  

	LongList reporter now uses a file to url conversion function
	instead of base arguments.

0.33 - Sun Jan 06 2002

	We renamed $link->never_checked to $link->is_not_checked().
	Now we document that.

	Handling of non-existent links is now corrected.

0.32 - Wed Jan 02 2002

	Dependency fixes based on CPAN test fail.

0.29 - Sat Dec 12 2001

	Substitutor interface completely re-worked.
	generate_file_substitutor is now the preferred entry point.

	This module is now completely independent from the
	Link_Controller system.  Functions such as
	translation of urls to local files names and back are supposed
	to be provided by the user as CODE references.
